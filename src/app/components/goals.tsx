        So, the master plan? Well, I'm all about tech, diving headfirst into the
        chaotic-yet-beautiful realms of{' '}
        <span className="text-orange-300">DevOps</span> and{' '}
        <span className="text-orange-300">Blockchain</span>. Yep, trying to tame
        the servers and ride the decentralized wave like a digital samurai.
        (*_*)

        But beyond the code? My ultimate mission is simple—be a{' '}
        <span className="text-orange-300">great human</span>, do some good in
        this world, and evolve into the best version of me. Maybe that means
        being an{' '}
        <span className="text-orange-300">elite software engineer</span> (⌨), or
        maybe fate has a surprise side-quest lined up—like diving into{' '}
        <span className="text-orange-300">astronomy</span> (☆) and decoding the
        secrets of the universe, or becoming a{' '}
        <span className="text-orange-300">mecha pilot</span> (okay, maybe not
        yet, but one can dream, right?).
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, whether it's building resilient systems,
        launching into space (Elon, call me?), or just jamming out to chill
        music with my <span className="text-orange-300">guitar</span>—I just
        want to keep leveling up and live a life that's straight out of a shonen
        anime. (^_^)
      </p>
      <p>
        TL;DR: Keep learning, stay curious, and build something
        meaningful—wherever life takes me. (^^)
